# TinyURL Service - Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup ✅ (COMPLETED)
- [x] Spring Boot project structure with Maven
- [x] Basic dependencies (Spring Web, JPA, Redis, Security, JWT, MySQL, Flyway)
- [x] Basic health controller
- [x] Application main class

## Phase 2: Database Setup ✅ (COMPLETED)
- [x] Create Flyway migration scripts for database schema
- [x] Set up `urls` table with code and normalized_url
- [x] Set up `user_urls` association table
- [x] Configure application.properties for MySQL connection

## Phase 3: Core Domain Models ✅ (COMPLETED)
- [x] Create URL entity class
- [x] Create UserUrl association entity
- [x] Create JPA repositories for data access
- [x] Add basic validation annotations

## Phase 4: JWT Authentication Service ✅ (COMPLETED)
- [x] Create JWT utility service for token generation/validation
- [x] Implement token endpoint (/api/token)
- [x] Create security configuration
- [x] Add JWT filter for request authentication

## Phase 5: URL Processing Service ✅ (COMPLETED)
- [x] Implement URL normalization logic
- [x] Create short code generation with Base36
- [x] Add collision detection and retry logic
- [x] Implement URL validation and blocklist checking

## Phase 6: Redis Caching Layer ✅ (COMPLETED)
- [x] Configure Redis connection
- [x] Create cache service for code↔URL mappings
- [x] Add TTL and LRU eviction policies
- [x] Implement cache hit/miss logging

## Phase 7: Core API Controllers ✅ (COMPLETED)
- [x] Implement POST /api/urls (create/get short URLs)
- [x] Implement GET /api/urls (list user's URLs)
- [x] Implement DELETE /api/urls/{code} (remove association)
- [x] Update health endpoint with deep checks

## Phase 8: Redirect Functionality ✅ (COMPLETED)
- [x] Create redirect controller for /{code} paths
- [x] Implement 301 permanent redirects
- [x] Add proper cache headers
- [x] Handle not found cases with JSON errors

## Phase 9: Logging and Monitoring ✅ (COMPLETED)
- [x] Set up structured JSON logging
- [x] Add request ID tracking
- [x] Implement action-based logging (create, get, redirect, delete)
- [x] Add cache hit/miss logging

## Phase 10: Testing and Validation ✅ (COMPLETED)
- [x] Write unit tests for all services
- [x] Write integration tests for API endpoints
- [x] Write tests for JWT authentication
- [x] Test Redis caching behavior
- [x] Test database operations and migrations

## Phase 11: Frontend Development ✅ (COMPLETED)
- [x] Create React application with TypeScript
- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS with CRACO
- [x] Implement token/login screen
- [x] Create URL shortening form
- [x] Build "My URLs" list view
- [x] Add copy and delete functionality

## Phase 12: Integration and Deployment 🔄 (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
- [ ] Create Docker configurations
- [ ] Set up docker-compose for local development
- [x] Configure CORS for frontend integration
- [ ] Test end-to-end functionality
- [ ] Optimize performance and caching

## Implementation Notes

### Current Status
- ✅ Complete backend implementation (Phases 1-10)
- ✅ Complete frontend implementation (Phase 11)
- ✅ All core features working as specified
- 🔄 Ready for integration testing and deployment

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Global URL Deduplication**: URLs are normalized and deduplicated globally, with user associations tracked separately
2. **JWT Authentication**: Stateless, permanent tokens with case-insensitive userId normalization
3. **Base36 Short Codes**: 7-character lowercase codes with collision retry (max 3 attempts)
4. **Redis Caching**: Bidirectional caching (code→URL, URL→code) with 5-minute TTL
5. **MySQL Storage**: Two-table design (urls, user_urls) with proper foreign key constraints

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each service layer
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Cache behavior testing
- Database migration testing
- End-to-end frontend integration testing

### Next Steps
Start with Phase 2: Database Setup by creating Flyway migration scripts and configuring the database connection.
